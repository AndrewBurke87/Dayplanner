This Program was created to help the user organize his or her day. As the day progresses it will block out time sections that have already passed and will highlight current hour in Red and Future Hours in Green. To make it easier to organize their day.

resources used were W3schools, Mozilla, Slackoverflow, previous activities and video from older sessions.

Next README.md will be better.
